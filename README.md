# BME160 - Research Programming in the Life Sciences
This course was my first introduction to programming, I started with the Python programming language and from here I learned a lot of the programming basics of object oriented programming. This course taught me the differnce between mutable and immutable obejects, the importance of documenting code - to add semantic value to the syntax of your code in any language. In term of life sciences, my introduction to FASTA and FASTQ files was in this course. I also learned how to find open reading frames from a DNA sequence file; developed my own Python module for DNA, protein, and RNA analysis; and a tRNA analysis program that found all unique subsets of a tRNA sequence. The introduction of classes through Python better prepared me for my string of CMPS/CSE courses in UCSC as I had a stronger understanding of ADTs and data structures going in to them. 
All code here was from my very first time programming - so it will be rougher than most of my other repositories. I also tutored this course for six months (2 offerings of this class).
